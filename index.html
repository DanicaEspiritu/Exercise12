	<h1>TOP 3 HIGHLY VISITED PLACES IN THE PHILIPPINES</h1>
	<p>The Philippines is a tropical paradise in the Pacific Ocean made up of more than 7,000 islands that offer a natural playground for your inner explorer. Collectively, its landscapes feature an array of natural wonders, from volcanoes and rice terraces to underwater rivers and limestone caves, along with beautiful beaches.
<br>
<br>
	Individually, the islands each offer something unique, whether you are looking for the best place to dive and snorkel or prefer to take in the historical sights in cities like Manila or Vigan, which have deep colonial roots.
<br>
<br>	
	Since the country is so spread out, a trip to the Philippines requires careful planning so that you can connect with the proper guides and find the most convenient lodging as a base for your favorite activities. Some destinations, like the Chocolate Hills in Bohol or the Hanging Coffins in Sagada, are remote, but getting there is well worth the effort.

			<h2>1. VIGAN</h2>
			<img src="Vigan.jfif" src="Vigan">
			<p>Vigan is an island, which used to be detached from the mainland by three rivers – the great Abra River, the Mestizo River and the Govantes River. It is unique among the Philippine towns because it is the country’s most extensive and only surviving historic city that dates back to the 16th century Spanish colonial period.
		<br><br>
			Vigan was an important coastal trading post in pre-colonial times. Long before the Spanish galleons, Chinese junks sailing from the South China Sea came to Isla de Bigan through the Mestizo River that surrounded the island. On board were sea-faring merchants that came to barter exotic goods from Asian kingdoms in exchange for gold, beeswax and other mountain products brought down by natives from the Cordilleras. Immigrants, mostly Chinese, settled in Vigan, intermarried with the natives and started the multi-cultural bloodline of the Bigueños.</p>

			<img src="Baguio.jpg" src="Baguio" class="baguiocity">
			<p>The name Baguio conjures, for both the international and domestic traveler, a highland retreat in the Grand Cordillera in Northern Luzon, with pine trees, crisp cold breezes and low verdant knolls and hillocks.
		<br><br>
			Through the numerous decades Baguio has morphed from what was once a grassy marshland into one of the cleanest and greenest, most highly urbanized cities in the country. It has made its mark as a premiere tourist destination in the Northern part of the Philippines with its cool climate, foggy hills, panoramic views and lovely flowers.
		<br><br>
			Being the ideal convergence zone of neighboring highland places, Baguio is the melting pot of different peoples and cultures and has boosted its ability to provide a center for education for its neighbors.

			<h2>3. MANILA</h2>
			<img src="Manila.jpg" src="Manila" class="mnl">
			<p>Manila (Tagalog: Lungsod ng Maynila) is the capital of the Philippines and the nation's center of education, business, and transportation. Metro Manila is the most populous metropolitan region composing the city of Manila and surrounding cities like Makati, Mandaluyong, Muntinlupa, Parañaque, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City and Taguig.
		<br><br>
			Manila has a reputation as a congested, polluted concrete jungle, and is often overlooked as a mere stopover for travellers aiming to reach other Philippine provinces or islands. To an extent this reputation is deserved, but Manila is nevertheless rapidly developing and has its own rich history and experiences to offer. The city is sprawling, bustling, and culturally complicated, with a colorful multi-cultural heritage and varied nightlife.</p>
